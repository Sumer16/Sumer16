I'm Sumer Patel, a MS in CS graduate student and a teaching assistant at Oregon State University. I'm also a memeber of the Software Innovation Track at Oregon State University. Previously, I have also worked as a UI developer at Accenture. I'm passionate about learning, improving and making things better, building, coding and developing software which impact the lives of people on a daily basis. 
<!--  I have worked on several full-stack web and mobile application projects and every project helped me learn and grow as a software developer. Lately, I'm really fascinated to learn more about the scalability and performance aspect involved in designing large-scale complex systems which drive this ever-growing and ever-demanding tech space. Here are some of the tools and technologies I've worked upon: -->

âš¡ Programming languages: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C/C++, HTML, CSS, SASS and Dart\
âš¡ Database Technologies: Firebase, MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL and S3\
âš¡ Frameworks: React, Node.js, Express, Angular, Nuxt.js, Next.js and Jest\
âš¡ Additional Skills: Azure, Figma, AWS, Git, Progessive Web Apps, Web Components, Jira and Rally\
